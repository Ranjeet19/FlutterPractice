Define two integer variables called netSalary and expenses.

Then write a program that prints different sentences depending on these conditions:

if netSalary > expenses
    You have saved $(netSalary - expenses) this month
otherwise if expenses > netSalary
    You have lost $(expenses - netSalary) this month
otherwise
    Your balance hasn't changed
Then verify that the program works correctly for different values of netSalary and expenses



<Code>
void main(){
  
  const int netSalary = 552000;
  
  const int expenses = 25000;
  
  final int currentState = netSalary - expenses;
  
 if(currentState==0){
   print('Aww! You have No money left in Your Bank');
   
 }else if(currentState <1000){
   print("Alert! Your bank balance is going to finished");
 }else{
   print("Bingo! You have enough balance, lets go for Shopping");
 }
  
  
   
}</Code>
